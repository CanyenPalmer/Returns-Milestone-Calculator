# Summary:
This project incorportates a mulitude of variables to determine the results. Focusing on timeline estimation for achieving finacial freedom (milestones), as well as you/your company's savings based off of pattern analysis/modelling. 

### Returns:
parameters = current_wealth, rate_of_return, monthly_savings, years

### Milestone:
parameters = current_wealth, rate_of_return, monthly_savings, target_wealth

# Conclusion:
After inputing all of your current estimations, you will receive your results. Dependant on which function you choose, the printed results will format differently.
For example, if you have the same estimations entered for both your 'returns' run code and 'milestone' run code, then the answers will be identical for the final run line.
In more detail, if the same information is entered on both with a timeline of 20 years, while the results for 20 years in both operations would result in the same answer, they still return differnt values.
- Returns: Year-By-Year breakdown
- Milestone: Predictive Model Estimate
